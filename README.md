Hello Everyone
If you are seeing this means that you have created a github account.
If not then please I recommend you to create one with Gmail or Outlook.
Do not use Temp Mail. You can use Edu mail also.
Steps - 
Go to your Github account and click on new repository.
Click on import repository.
Paste this link in the URL section :- https://github.com/BenjaminPeron31/rdp
Click on import. Wait for a while for it to be imported.
Now click on the file name. For example 'TechProWorks/rdp' as shown in the video.
Click on Settings and then click on Secrets.
Then Click on New repository secret.
Now go to ngrok.com. Click on Get started for free. Click on Signup with Github.
Then click on 'authorize ngrok-private'. In this way it will connect to your Github account. Signup with Github only.
Click on Your Authtoken. Copy the ngrok auth token and go back to Github page.
Now type the repository secret name as 'NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN'. And paste your authtoken in the value section.
Now you are all set. Now click on Actions then select workflow as 'Mrhaxter'.
Click on Run workflow from main branch.
Now refresh the page and then select the workflow. Click on build.
Now wait for a while and then your rdp credentials will be generated.
Thank you.
